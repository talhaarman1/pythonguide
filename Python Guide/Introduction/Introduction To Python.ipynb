    "### Dynamic typing :\n",
    "\n",
    "Python keeps track of the kinds of objects your program uses when it runs; it doesn't require complicated type and size declarations in your code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in object types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides commonly used data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and strings, as an intrinsic part of the language; as we'll see, they're both flexible and easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "To process all those object types, Python comes with powerful and standard operations, including concatenation (joining collections), slicing (extracting sections), sorting, mapping, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Library utilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "For more specific tasks, Python also comes with a large collection of precoded library tools that support everything from regular-expression matching to networking to object persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third-party utilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Python is freeware, it encourages developers to contribute precoded tools that support tasks beyond Python's built-ins; you'll find free support for COM, imaging, CORBA ORBs, XML, and much more\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic memory management:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python automatically allocates and reclaims (\"garbage collects\") objects when no longer used, and most grow and shrink on demand; Python, not you, keeps track of low-level memory details.\n"
